1. **[Altair Practice Project](https://github.com/lb930/Data-Visualisation/tree/master/Altair/Altair%20Practice%20Project)**: My first attempt at a visualisation using Altair.
2. **[Makeover Monday](https://github.com/lb930/Data-Visualisation/tree/master/MakeoverMonday)**: Every Monday the [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) team publishes a dataset and an accompanying data visualisation with the goal of encouraging people to improve on the visualisation. I am using Altair to create visualisations which can also be found [here](https://lb930.github.io/Data-Science-Blog/).
